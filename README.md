# PacketLabREU
This repository contains the work I did as a research intern for the PacketLab group at the University of Illinois. 
The files contain various network experiments that I created in C.
My main experiment is in bottleneck.c, which is an experiment that tries to identify bottlenecks along a route to a destination.
